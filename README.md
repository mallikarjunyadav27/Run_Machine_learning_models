Overview  

Aura RunML is a Machine Learning customized monitoring tool which helps the user to get in depth insights of Model status health, by simple monitor builder, and get alerts for issues like concept drift, model performance degradation, bias and more.   

Aura RunML brings transparency to your Data Model which detects drifts, data integrity, performance, data quality, Unique, Missing values, Count, Infinite, Categories, Std/Mean, etc.   

Aura RunML is an intuitive tool which is easy to use and monitor with privacy focused on a unified environment.  

In current State of the Art technologies, monitoring our Ai/ML Model deployed in production will have the pipeline as mentioned in the Architecture diagram     

To monitor our end-end pipeline one must fiddle around many dashboards to track the health and performance of data/model in different platforms   

This will become chaotic when we Monitor different usecase in different environments    

Aura RunML has a simple Architecture in mind and provides observability in a unified environment which helps the user to maintain and monitor the data/model in a single place to track the status with ease of intuitive UI.
